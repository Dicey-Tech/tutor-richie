Richie connector plugin app for Open edX
========================================

This is an `Open edX plugin <https://github.com/edx/edx-django-utils/blob/master/edx_django_utils/plugins/README.rst>`__ to facilitate the integration of a `Richie <https://richie.education>`__  learning portal. Its main feature is automatically syncing course properties when they are updated in the Open edX studio.
